Yellow Peril, NYU May 2015</p>
<p>Hello Kitty is a global phenomenon. Created in 1974 by Japan’s Sanrio Corporation, the little white cat with a bow in her hair now rakes in about $7b per year, earning company founder Shintaro Tsuji a place among the richest men in the world (Walker). Hello Kitty’s reemergence in the 1990‘s was an early frontrunner in a trend that now includes countless animated shows, Nintendo, the Pokemon franchise, and Harajuku fashion. In 2015, “Kawaii culture” is still on the rise, and continues to influence international perception of Japan.</p>

<p>American singers capitalizing on the success of Japanese pop culture is nothing new. We saw this in 2004 with Gwen Stefani’s “Harajuku Girls” &#8212; a group of four backup dancers, three Japanese and one Japanese American, who performed with Stefani on tour and in several of her music videos. Nicknamed “Love,” “Angel,” “Music,” and “Baby,” the dancers were frequently criticized for perpetuating stereotypes of Asian woman. Comedienne Margaret Cho, herself of Korean ancestry, likened the ensemble to a “minstrel show,” writing on her blog that “Even though to me, a Japanese schoolgirl uniform is kind of like blackface, I am just in acceptance over it, because something is better than nothing” (Cho).</p>

Although all profess their love of Japanese culture is genuine, the country’s $4.3b music industry is likely also a big motivator (Bremner, Yasu). More Japanese fans means more records sold. Lavigne and the rest are not afraid to tie themselves to popular juggernauts &#8212; consider Perry’s televised meeting with Japanese star Kyary Pamyu Pamyu or Gaga’s seashell bra-adorned Hello Kitty doll. Lavigne’s</p>

<p>2014 song “Hello Kitty,” and the accompany music video, is the latest iteration of this financial exploitation of kawaii culture.</p>
<p>“Hello Kitty’s” nonsensical lyrics, coupled with a video that has<br />
been universally condemned, sets it apart as particularly egregious.<br />
Lavigne, dressed in a low-cut black bodice and a cupcake skirt, sings<br />
about a girly sleepover, later chanting a chorus of “Come come kitty kitty, you’re so pretty pretty.” More than nonsensical, the lyrics are also slightly sexual &#8212; some critics have wondered if “kitty” could be a euphemism for female genitalia &#8212; which is creepy in the context of the almost prepubescent-styled dancers and sterile set decor. In any case, Lavigne’s message is unclear.</p>
<p>Whatever the intent, “Hello Kitty” sees Lavigne impose her own view of Japan onto the world. She fetishizes the culture, turning an entire society into “kawaii,” candy, and a cartoon cat. In perpetuating the Harajuku schtick, she lets a subculture be representative of an entire country. The American public is constantly bombarded by stories and images of “weird” Japan, and Lavigne does nothing to change this perception. This is damaging because not only does she profit off misrepresentation, she also encourages her substantial fan base to think of Japan in the same freaky, sexual way she does.</p>
<p>Writing for Vox, critic Zack Beauchamp calls the song and video an “unintentionally offensive homage” (Beauchamp). This is probably a fair assessment, as Lavigne has maintained she had no intention of offending anyone, and worked specifically with Japanese actors and directors in the production of the video (Lavigne). This is to be commended, but a Japanese director and background dancers is not enough. Cross-cultural music and art should be encouraged, but to be cross-cultural means both parties should be given a voice. Had Avril written more meaningful lyrics, collaborated with a Japanese artist, or used Japan in any way other than as decoration, the reaction might have been completely different.</p>

<p>I decided to make a “Hello Kitty” parody, as I thought it would be most appropriate to respond to a song with a song. As I am no music producer, what I ended up creating is more of a rough mix than a fully-mastered product, but the message is there. Had I been able to keep going with this, I would have liked to shoot a video as well and uploaded it to Youtube, as I think that would have a greater impact than a song alone.</p>

<p>My idea for the parody was to exaggerate Lavigne’s obsession with harajuku/anime culture even further. The lyrics show a person who is a xenophile to the extreme, the hope being that in overemphasizing Lavigne’s behavior, the offense will become clear. I changed almost all of the lyrics, but I kept the original Japanese lines, as I couldn’t think of anything more ridiculous than what she had already written. In my experience, humor is more effective than most things in trying to get a point across, so hopefully you will find this version as funny as I do.</p>
