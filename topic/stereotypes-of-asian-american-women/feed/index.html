Yellow Peril, NYU May 2015</p>
<p>Hello Kitty is a global phenomenon. Created in 1974 by Japan’s Sanrio Corporation, the little white cat with a bow in her hair now rakes in about $7b per year, earning company founder Shintaro Tsuji a place among the richest men in the world (Walker). Hello Kitty’s reemergence in the 1990‘s was an early frontrunner in a trend that now includes countless animated shows, Nintendo, the Pokemon franchise, and Harajuku fashion. In 2015, “Kawaii culture” is still on the rise, and continues to influence international perception of Japan.</p>

<p>American singers capitalizing on the success of Japanese pop culture is nothing new. We saw this in 2004 with Gwen Stefani’s “Harajuku Girls” &#8212; a group of four backup dancers, three Japanese and one Japanese American, who performed with Stefani on tour and in several of her music videos. Nicknamed “Love,” “Angel,” “Music,” and “Baby,” the dancers were frequently criticized for perpetuating stereotypes of Asian woman. Comedienne Margaret Cho, herself of Korean ancestry, likened the ensemble to a “minstrel show,” writing on her blog that “Even though to me, a Japanese schoolgirl uniform is kind of like blackface, I am just in acceptance over it, because something is better than nothing” (Cho).</p>

Although all profess their love of Japanese culture is genuine, the country’s $4.3b music industry is likely also a big motivator (Bremner, Yasu). More Japanese fans means more records sold. Lavigne and the rest are not afraid to tie themselves to popular juggernauts &#8212; consider Perry’s televised meeting with Japanese star Kyary Pamyu Pamyu or Gaga’s seashell bra-adorned Hello Kitty doll. Lavigne’s</p>

<div class="column">
<p>2014 song “Hello Kitty,” and the accompany music video, is the latest iteration of this financial exploitation of kawaii culture.</p>
<p>“Hello Kitty’s” nonsensical lyrics, coupled with a video that has<br />
been universally condemned, sets it apart as particularly egregious.<br />
Lavigne, dressed in a low-cut black bodice and a cupcake skirt, sings<br />
about a girly sleepover, later chanting a chorus of “Come come kitty kitty, you’re so pretty pretty.” More than nonsensical, the lyrics are also slightly sexual &#8212; some critics have wondered if “kitty” could be a euphemism for female genitalia &#8212; which is creepy in the context of the almost prepubescent-styled dancers and sterile set decor. In any case, Lavigne’s message is unclear.</p>
<p>Whatever the intent, “Hello Kitty” sees Lavigne impose her own view of Japan onto the world. She fetishizes the culture, turning an entire society into “kawaii,” candy, and a cartoon cat. In perpetuating the Harajuku schtick, she lets a subculture be representative of an entire country. The American public is constantly bombarded by stories and images of “weird” Japan, and Lavigne does nothing to change this perception. This is damaging because not only does she profit off misrepresentation, she also encourages her substantial fan base to think of Japan in the same freaky, sexual way she does.</p>
<p>Writing for Vox, critic Zack Beauchamp calls the song and video an “unintentionally offensive homage” (Beauchamp). This is probably a fair assessment, as Lavigne has maintained she had no intention of offending anyone, and worked specifically with Japanese actors and directors in the production of the video (Lavigne). This is to be commended, but a Japanese director and background dancers is not enough. Cross-cultural music and art should be encouraged, but to be cross-cultural means both parties should be given a voice. Had Avril written more meaningful lyrics, collaborated with a Japanese artist, or used Japan in any way other than as decoration, the reaction might have been completely different.</p>

<p>I decided to make a “Hello Kitty” parody, as I thought it would be most appropriate to respond to a song with a song. As I am no music producer, what I ended up creating is more of a rough mix than a fully-mastered product, but the message is there. Had I been able to keep going with this, I would have liked to shoot a video as well and uploaded it to Youtube, as I think that would have a greater impact than a song alone.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>My idea for the parody was to exaggerate Lavigne’s obsession with harajuku/anime culture even further. The lyrics show a person who is a xenophile to the extreme, the hope being that in overemphasizing Lavigne’s behavior, the offense will become clear. I changed almost all of the lyrics, but I kept the original Japanese lines, as I couldn’t think of anything more ridiculous than what she had already written. In my experience, humor is more effective than most things in trying to get a point across, so hopefully you will find this version as funny as I do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Futuba Shioda<br />
Written for Yellow Peril, NYU Spring 2015</p>
<p>It was a slightly cloudy but reasonably sunny day in June, a few days after my fourteenth birthday and several days before school would be released and summer would arrive like an endless, warm embrace of lounging and green ferns. He sat next to me in his old car, parked in front of our old elementary school where we must have crossed paths as small children, but neither of us could remember since he was four years my senior. A senior. I was sitting in a car next to a senior who found me fascinating and adorable and attractive. He had confessed his interest in me soon after graduating high school just a few weeks back, after we had spent the semester in our high school production of <em>Wizard of Oz</em> together. He took me on long walks by the reservoir and gave me my first kiss under luscious trees. He invited me to his graduation party and introduced me to his family. He told me he was infatuated with me. Of course, looking back, the only things I remember him saying on our walks included the words “You” “are” and “cute.” His graduation party was held in the town Rotary Club and I remember seeing a giant painting in the entryway depicting the overtaking of Iwo Jima, which set an uncomfortable tone for being one of three non-white people at the party (one of the others being my best friend whom I dragged along). And I remember Googling “infatuated” and finding the definition slightly concerning; “be inspired with an intense but short-lived passion or admiration for; inspired or possessed with a foolish or unreasoning passion.” I remember having a soft but insistent voice always asking me if he really liked me or if he even really knew me beyond his honeymoon assumptions.</p>
<p>Back in the car, he turned towards me and smiled, handing over a loosely wrapped package. I opened it to find a mixed CD and my heart fluttered, because a real live boy had thoughtfully put together music for me! He smiled wider and said that there was a special surprise at the end of the CD. When I finally got home later that day, I shut myself in the study and put the CD into our CD player, plugged my headphones into it for privacy, and skipped to the final song. I sat there, little tears filling my eyes as I fantasized how we would live our lives out together, listening to his song and whispering aloud that it was the most beautiful song in the world.</p>
<p><span id="more-257"></span>Today, I can say that it’s probably one of the worst songs I’ve ever downloaded onto my iTunes account. It’s not because of the chords, the voice, or even the strange warped guitar slides between every verse. And it’s not because it’s a song written by a guy I used to date and no longer have any connection with (at least not entirely…). It’s because as I’ve grown older, moved out of my small suburban town, seen more of the world and learned more about myself, the lyrics of his song seem progressively more offensive. Here are some of the lyrics from his love ode to me:</p>
<p><em>“I’d travel all the way to Tokyo to see your face…”</em></p>
<p><em>            “All that matters to me is that you will forever be my Tokyo Girl.”</em></p>
<p><em>            “When I hear you speak in native tongue it turns me on…oh you                   make me want to learn the language of the sun.” </em></p>
<p>In addition to these words, the chorus of the song is simply the phrase “Tokyo Girl” repeated over and over again.</p>
<p>Looking back at the context of our situation, the factors and dynamics in our relationship seem almost too cliché. I discovered that in terms of categories, his dominance in society’s hierarchy almost made it inevitable that we viewed each other the way we did. I’m not justifying the creation of his song, but here’s a look at our circumstances.</p>

<p>What were the dynamics in our town? The majority of our peers in high school were white, Christian, conservative, and straight. I was in many of the devalued/desposed/phobic categories of our environment, and he was in many of the valued/loved/philic categories. The number of Pacific Asian students in our school were scarce, only outnumbering the handful of Hispanic students. And to add to this, he was exposed to the generally misleading representation of Asians and Asian women in the media. He <em>did</em> write the song and I place the responsibility of it on him, but he wrote it in a world that conditioned him to see me as an exotic, exciting, foreign object to place upon a pedestal and admire.</p>
<p>The connotation of “Tokyo Girl” is racist because it assumes that I, as an Asian American who was born and raised in the Boston area, am still foreign to a country that I am a citizen of. Associating me with a Japanese city brings up many images and characteristics that define me through a propaganda lens. Asian women are constantly described and depicted as slim, beautiful, fragile geishas who are submissive to men and eager to please both in labor and in sex. This stereotype arises from the Western colonization of Asian countries. As analyzed in the University of Michigan website called “Asian Americans in the Media”, “since colonization inherently implies ownership, Asian women were viewed as commodities to be possessed. Their identities of being Asian females no longer implied agency or invoked a sense of individuality but were viewed by Westerners as “Asian” (UMich; Cheng, Hsieh, Lu, Talgo).</p>
<p>The foreignness of Asian American women continues to “Other” them, as well as objectify them. The main tropes that I find have been used to define me are “The Madame Butterfly” and the “Dragon Lady.” I’m also going to add the “Tokyo Girl” stereotype that arose from the song written to me. These stereotypes are found on TV, movies, music videos, theater, books, and most other media platforms. The “Madame Butterfly” trope is based off of Puccini’s opera of the same name, in which a Japanese geisha kills herself after bearing a son to a Western Lieutenant and waiting for his return, only to discover he has remarried to a white woman. This “prostitute with a golden heart” who needs saving from a Western man is a repeated character, originally derived from the Western need to feminize the East and therefore sexually dominate the East. Examples include Kim from the Broadway musical “Miss Saigon” and Liat from the Broadway musical “South Pacific.” This trope, which has eventually stemmed off into the “Tokyo Girl” trope, adds to the racist idea of “Yellow Fever”, in which white men are afflicted with the romantic and sexual desire for Asian women. The “Dragon Lady” trope, though slightly divergent from my particular experience with the song, is also a repeated trope. A female version of the “Fu Manchu” stereotype, a trope developed from the villain character of “Fu Manchu” (which epitomized the threat of the East during the 20<sup>th</sup> century (and beyond)), the “Dragon Lady” is a severe and heartless Asian woman usually associated with chopsticks, high buns, and weapons in the form of samurai swords and fans.</p>
<p>The “Tokyo Girl” stereotype is a more recent trope that has developed to infantalize the Asian girl. This stereotype takes the long, straight black hair ideal of the “Madame Butterfly” look and makes her an adorable, anime-styled doll who is cute, diminutive, and 2-dimensional. Examples of this trope can be seen in music videos such as “Hello Kitty” by singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne (2013) and “Harajuku Girls” by singer-songwriter Gwen Stefani. Both of these white female artists use Japanese girls as robotic backup dancers who are simultaneously put up on a pedestal and dehumanized. This trope best fits my experience with the song, and perpetuates the idea that I am cute, collectable, and submissive.</p>
<p>In order to combat this racism, many Asian women are showing examples of Asian women who defy this stereotype. For example, the documentary “Seeking Asian Female” (2012) by Debbie Lum follows an older white male who mail orders a Chinese bride in hopes that she will make him happy, serve him, and be the perfect wife. The documentary illustrates how different the Chinese wife is from his assumptions, having fully human desires, complaints, and characteristics, and breaks down both the white man and the Asian American documentarian’s biases about this Chinese woman moving to America for marriage. Further examples include the cartoon “Angry Little Asian Girl” created by Lela Lee in 1994. It portrays a small little Asian girl who, upon first glance, looks like the cute, submissive Asian girl that falls into the “Tokyo Girl” trope. However, in every cartoon and animated episode, the girl showcases her anger towards racism, sexism, and other oppressive hierarchies, by cursing profusely and being vulgar. This cartoon defies the stereotype and portrays more layers of Asian women by representing a new kind of Asian heroine.</p>
<p>I decided to fight the “Tokyo Girl” stereotype by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9xQsoT_KkE" target="_blank">writing a rebuttal song</a> to the song my ex wrote for me. In response to his racist lyrics, I wrote these lyrics:</p>
<p><iframe width="474" height="356" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s9xQsoT_KkE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Hey ___, Do you remember me?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You wrote a song for me back when I was about fourteen</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>It was endearing, but upon hearing it again</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’m kind of feeling a lot of things</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Like “What the fuck were you thinking?”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’m not trying to paint you as an ass</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I promise I’m doing this for a class</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>But you called me your Tokyo girl</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Frankly that just makes me want to hurl</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I am not your geisha toy</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The same way you’re not a pilgrim boy</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’ll break it down for you</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>My passport’s red and white and blue</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Now that you’re twenty-four</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I should tell you, I’d never been to Tokyo before</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>But even if I had, let me say it’s just as bad</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>But maybe the fault is really mine</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I should’ve said, “I won’t love you long time.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Your assumptions were downright wrong</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>And don’t say my native tongue “turns you on”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>And you called me your Tokyo Girl</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Frankly that just makes me want to hurl</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’m not saying I’m not Japanese</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Just don’t assume I’m good at math please</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>But I am not your Tokyo Girl</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Frankly that just makes me actually hurl</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Society told you that I’m foreign a bit</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Now you know that that’s racist shit</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em><em>That’s racist shit…”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This sort of response gives voice to the masses of Asian women who are clumped together and defined through racist, oppressive ideals. By combating the stereotypes and tropes placed on Asian and Asian American women, while also recognizing and celebrating our identities in both communal and individual senses, the racist homogenization of Asians in America can be tackled.</p>
