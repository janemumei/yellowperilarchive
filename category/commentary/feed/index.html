				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nora Hexter<br />
Yellow Peril, NYU Spring 2015</p>
<p>Growing up as a Korean American adoptee with White parents, I accepted transnational adoption—my own adoption—solely as an act of love. I understood the creation of families with babies from overseas as my own story, a story I could claim with pride. Growing up as a Korean American adoptee with White parents, I recognized that I was different from my mom and dad by the color of our skin; I did not recognize that we were also different in other critical and meaningful ways. Growing up as a Korean American adoptee with White parents, I never considered how much my adoption cost—how much <em>I </em>cost or why White middle-class couples chose to adopt from countries like Korea or China or why this <em>industry</em> or <em>market</em> could be problematic.</p>
<p>The artifact I chose for this project is the image shown here.<span id="more-299"></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-300 size-full" src="http://jonoyuan.github.io/yellowperilarchive/wp-content/uploads/KoreanStudies_SooJinPate.jpg" alt="KoreanStudies_SooJinPate" width="1199" height="856" srcset="http://jonoyuan.github.io/yellowperilarchive/wp-content/uploads/KoreanStudies_SooJinPate.jpg 1199w, http://jonoyuan.github.io/yellowperilarchive/wp-content/uploads/KoreanStudies_SooJinPate-300x214.jpg 300w, http://jonoyuan.github.io/yellowperilarchive/wp-content/uploads/KoreanStudies_SooJinPate-1024x731.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1199px) 100vw, 1199px" /></p>
<p>Taken by the United States Department of State in 1953, the photograph shows three smiling White American G.I.s holding three Korean girls, orphaned during the years of the Korean War. As someone who grew up with a normalized conceptualization of mixed-race families and of White adults with Asian children, something about this picture still struck me as uncomfortable and unsettling. Through this artifact, I was able to explore many facets of the historical and political implications of the South Korean transnational adoption system, as well as my own personal and emotional attachment to the idea of adoption. Although it has taken some time, I have come to terms with both the segmentation and integration of the personal and the political when it comes to this topic.</p>
<p>Since the origins of transnational adoption from South Korea following the years of the Korean War in the 1950s, approximately 200,000 children have been adopted overseas, with about seventy five percent of these children adopted to families the United States.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The “end” of the Korean War in 1953 left behind many orphaned children, as well as illegitimate, mixed-race children born to Korean mothers and American military fathers. Overseas adoption from South Korea quickly became institutionalized and consequently, “South Korea became the largest supplier of children to developed countries in the world.”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The Korean transnational adoption system ultimately became like a “surrogate welfare system for…Korean children.”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> Ultimately, as Eleana Kim succinctly states, “a grossly under-funded social welfare system, patriarchal family ideologies and misogynistic legal codes in Korea coincided with high demand for adoptable children in the West, especially in the U.S.”<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>
<p>Further, in the United States during the 1970s and 80s, abortion became legal and reliable birth control methods became available. This means that there was a decline in adoptable White babies, and perspective adoptive couples significantly outnumbered the number of babies available to adopt. In addition, there was also an increase in controversy over White parents adopting Black children and thus, couples wishing to adopt turned to overseas adoption. Because South Korea’s adoption “had become extremely efficient, reliable, and reportedly free from corruption,”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[5]</sup></a> childless parents in the U.S. saw South Korean babies as the best alternative for adoption. Thus, South Korea and the United States formed a special transnational adoption relationship, with Korea depending on the United States to “import” babies.</p>
<p>In 1955, Harry and Bertha Holt saw images such as the artifact above and were moved by the number of Korean orphans who needed a family after losing theirs to the war. The Holts adopted eight children and eventually founded the Holt International Children’s Services. This received a great deal of media coverage and thus, many other White upper middle class couples began adopting from South Korea. The artifact that I’ve chosen has provided a deeper understanding of why these families felt so obliged to bring orphaned children into their homes and families.</p>
<p>In the artifact I have chosen, three of the individuals photographed are part of the United States army. The military in the United States is seen as the ultimate source of national protection and defense from outside threats. The military is often glorified and valorized as a body of force necessary in spreading the democratic ideals of this country. Further, the military is also deployed in intervening for political purposes, as in the Korean War when the U.S. entered South Korea in fears of it falling to communism. In the name of liberation, the military often asserts itself in non-Western nations to “rescue” the people from what the United States perceives as dangers of their own government or rulers.</p>
<p>The photograph seems to speak to the White savior complex of the Western world that asserts non-Western countries need the White West to save them from their primitive, savage ways of life. The smiles of the G.I.s in my artifact suggest that they do not fully the understand the complexities of the loss these young Korean girls will experience in their lives. Likely, their parents are dead, or have been separated from them in the war. Either way, these young girls are suddenly orphaned and likely have little chance of finding new families without the system of transnational adoption in place.</p>
<p>In Bertha Holt’s book <em>The Seed from the East </em>(1956), she recounts the events that led her and Harry to adopt eight children from Korea. After watching several films introduced to them by the President of World Vision (an organization that helps sponsor children in need), Bertha reflects on her unsettling feelings:</p>
<blockquote><p>Then came the scenes that shattered our hearts. We saw before us the tragic plight of hundreds of illegitimate children…GI-babies…children that had American fathers and Korean mothers…children that had been hidden by remorseful mothers until it was no longer possible to keep their secret. Finally the children were allowed to roam the streets where they were often beaten by other children who had never known Koreans with blond hair…or blue eyes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, Harry decides that it’s time to take some of these children into their home:</p>
<blockquote><p>Every night when I go to bed, I see those pictures all over again. It doesn’t make any difference where I am or what I’m doing. I think about those kids over there. I look out here at this beautiful playground God has so generously given us and something inside of me cries out at the thought of those poor little babies starving to death, or being thrown into dumps to be gnawed by rats.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bertha and Harry, while well intentioned, echo the orientalization of Korean bodies, especially in the phrase “poor little babies.” I can’t help but see this description as patronizing and condescending, reducing these orphaned Korean babies to objects only God can rescue through the help of willing Christian adoptive parents. The Holts’ desire to save the “poor little babies” seems founded upon White guilt that simultaneously acknowledges their own privilege while also “other”-ing Korea as a foreign country in need of Western heroes.</p>
<p>In my artifact, the militaristic quality of the three G.I.s provides a sense of protection and paternalism. They are smiling widely which portrays the White male savior image as one that is intrinsically happy and positive—signaling to prospective adoptive families that only good things can come of their rescuing of the “poor little babies.” In terms of Yellow Peril, my artifact brings to light the tenuous nature of the origins of South Korean transnational adoption. In the image, an uncomfortable power dynamic pervades. In the idealized formation of adopted families, the power dynamic is most often not spoken of—rather, family is love, family is acceptance, family is one and the same. When the military is embedded in this idealized image of the production and creation of family, the power dynamic is more conspicuous. The military, especially one as large and as powerful as the United States&#8217;, is commonly associated with coercion and inevitably imperialism and colonization.</p>
<p>I like to think that my own adoption story is one of love. My parents—a White, upper middle-class college-educated couple—turned to transnational adoption when they discovered they could not reproduce on their own, and adoption seemed like their only option for having children. In the mid-1990s, years after the Korean War, images of orphaned children in a country devastated by war were not prevalent. Rather, unwed mothers struggling with the social stigma of being unmarried and poor became the common image for potential adoptive parents.</p>
<p>Because transnational adoptions generate approximately thirty five million dollars a year, South Korea has, in the past, prioritized sending babies overseas rather than financially assisting unwed mothers to raise their babies on their own. Further, the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) has developed a social expenditure database “in order to serve a growing need for indicators of social policy.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[6]</sup></a> According to the OECD social expenditure, South Korea has the second lowest social expenditure following Mexico.</p>
<p>Adoptive parents in the United States pay approximately $30,000 to adopt a baby from South Korea. The Korean government provides single mothers with a monthly stipend of about $48. If the money from one adoption went to support a mother take care of her baby, she would receive enough monthly stipends for over 30 years. However, $48 is not nearly enough money on which support a child. Therefore, the $30,000 from an adoption could fully support the mother and her child for the first five crucial years of her child’s life.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>
<p>Despite Korea’s economic benefit, transnational adoptions from Korea to the U.S. have significantly decreased due to international shaming of Korea as a “baby exporting nation.” In the late 1980s, close to 8,000 babies were adopted overseas; a decade later, approximately 2,000 babies were adopted; in 2013 only 138 babies were adopted by families in the United States. Further, Korea has one of the world’s largest economies and thus, babies may not need to be “saved” from the devastation of war.</p>
<p>My artifact has not only allowed to me research the historical significance of transnational adoption, but also the emotional and personal. It is hard to equate my own, loving parents to the G.I.s in the photograph and it’s hard to imagine that they adopted my sister and me out of charity or on the premise of rescue or savior. But through this project, I came to wonder if Lillian and I are, nevertheless, products of orientalizing Western imperialism. Am I part of the United States’ liberation of the East from their ignorance and savagery?</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1"></a></p>
<p>I’m still not quite sure how to answer this question. I don’t think my own White parents saw Koreans or Asians as less than them and I don’t think they personally feared the East. In fact, my parents, progressively <em>un</em>-patriotic towards the United States, encouraged my sister and me to explore our Korean heritage in every way we could—resulting in weekly mornings at Korean school and a trip to Korea in 2004. With this artifact, I am still attempting to reconcile the White savior complex that most likely brought about the institutionalization of transnational adoption between Korea and the U.S. and the inevitable privilege I have acquired from being the daughter of White parents. This paradox has become apparent to me throughout this semester through my research.</p>
<p>On paper, I am White. Jewish, maybe. Eastern European. On paper, I am a White female with White parents, a U.S. citizen, a resident of Boston, Massachusetts. I arrived at Logan Airport in Boston with a Korean passport—my name was Myung Jee. As I became the daughter of Jim Hexter and Eileen Haggerty, I was naturalized into the country that once saw my birth land as incapable of standing on its own and taking care of its children. I became naturalized into the country that saw my birth land’s children as “poor little babies.” I became naturalized into the country that believed babies born in my birth land needed to be rescued and saved.</p>

<p>In my many efforts to find a subaltern artifact that I could find some personal connection to, I came across a New York Times article about something called Art Adds. In January 2010, three NYC artists had their work featured on taxi cab cones in this project organized by Show Media and the Art Production fund. Shirin Neshat was one of these artists, and her mixed media piece <em>Offered Eyes</em> (1993) was the work chosen to be displayed. I didn’t know a lot about the artist then, but I did know that like myself, she was of Persian descent, and that she was critically acclaimed by Iranians and Americans alike.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-289" src="http://jonoyuan.github.io/yellowperilarchive/wp-content/uploads/Image-1-1024x687.png" alt="Image 1" width="474" height="318" srcset="http://jonoyuan.github.io/yellowperilarchive/wp-content/uploads/Image-1-1024x687.png 1024w, http://jonoyuan.github.io/yellowperilarchive/wp-content/uploads/Image-1-300x201.png 300w, http://jonoyuan.github.io/yellowperilarchive/wp-content/uploads/Image-1.png 1223w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px" /></p>

<p><span id="more-288"></span></p>
<p>I thought it was totally weird and rad that her art would be shown in this way. I couldn’t really believe a work by a Persian artist, especially one that looked so overtly Middle Eastern, could be chosen to be made as highly visible as this. It became even more interesting to me when I learned of Neshat’s intention behind the remediation: according to the article, she had apparently chose the piece because she felt it spoke to the other-ness of the South Asian cab drivers in the city.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The original piece, <em>Offered Eyes</em>, is a self portrait that the artist made after her first return to Iran in 1990, after 15 years spent in the US. What had once been a quite western nation was now deeply Islamist and nativistic because of the change of government that accompanied the 1979 revolution. Women now were now mandated to wear the chador instead of the American and British fashions as they once favored. The Iran-Iraq War had brought eight years of strife and destruction upon the nation, and drove many of these women to take up arms and enter the battlefield as warriors, veil and all. Everything had changed since Neshat had left, and now her homeland was everything but—a totally unfamiliar, foreign place.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-290" src="http://jonoyuan.github.io/yellowperilarchive/wp-content/uploads/Image-2.png" alt="Image 2" width="544" height="827" srcset="http://jonoyuan.github.io/yellowperilarchive/wp-content/uploads/Image-2.png 544w, http://jonoyuan.github.io/yellowperilarchive/wp-content/uploads/Image-2-197x300.png 197w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" /></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Not only was she unfamiliar with the new culture, but she had missed out on a traumatic moment in her nation’s history that had come to shape the Iranian identity. “It wasn&#8217;t just the revolution, it was all these years of war with Iraq&#8230; years of grief&#8230; In a very strange way I was envious of them&#8230; In looking at how profound their experience had been, I felt so very much an outsider and so stupidly narcissistic.”<sup>3</sup> Her years away had made her a stranger to the new Iranian experience, driving a wedge between her Persian and newly forged American identities.</p>
<p>She communicated this sense of cultural loss, disconnect and pure shock through the Women of Allah series, which she made upon her return to the United States. Spanning from 1993 to 1997, these works documented her “perception and understanding” of the new Iranian woman she had witnessed.<sup>4</sup></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>However, because she was making these photographs in NYC for an audience of New Yorkers (it would prove quite difficult to legally display the work in Iran), Neshat was also heavily aware of “how profound the gap was between Iran and its perception abroad&#8230;Westerners have this sense that Iranian women are submissive victims. But they’re not victims, and they’re certainly not submissive.”<sup>5</sup> The imposition of the chador in Iran seemed to delude her western audience into considering “the veil as a symbol of Muslim women’s oppression.” For this reason, Neshat wanted “the subjects of these images [to] look strong and imposing&#8230;[and] transform the female body into that of a warrior, determined and even heroic.”<sup>6</sup> If there was one thing Neshat learned in her return to Iran, it was that Iranian women were able to endure and thrive in the most difficult of circumstances, and these photos serve to challenge any stereotypes that claim otherwise.</p>
<p>Through performance, text, and the subject’s gaze, Women of Allah functions both as a means to process the artist’s personal culture shock and address the western delusions of Middle Eastern women.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The gaze of the woman in<em> Offered Eyes</em> encompasses this entirely. The title of the series, <em>Women of Allah</em>, and the Farsi script make it clear to the audience that they meet the gaze of an Iranian (or at least Middle Eastern) woman, and this immediately calls to mind whatever personal conceptions of this being the viewer has. They must then meet the confrontational gaze with these notions at the front of their mind. The gaze is confrontational because of its steadfastness and somewhat ambivalent emotional read behind it. Is the woman expressing strength or weakness through her gaze? Is she challenging the viewer, or merely observing them? Regardless, the piece is able to incite some type of communication between the viewer and the viewed, and that seems to fulfill the artist’s intention behind it.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>In 2010, Show Media and the Art Production Fund approached three artists whose work they felt was quintessentially New York and could read well in the confined space of a taxi cab cone. Shirin Neshat was one of these artists. The New York Times reports that “when she was approached about the project, her first thought was of the Pakistani- and Sengalese-born taxi drivers. ‘I felt I could make work that was truly non-Western, because it’s an extension of what New York is about,’ Ms. Neshat said.” Out of her entire body of work, she chose <em>Offered Eyes</em> in part because of its prominent use of Farsi script, as “‘It suggests that someone is speaking to you in a language that no one can understand,’” alluding to the foreignness of the cab drivers to a western consumer.<sup>7</sup></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The confrontation incited by <em>Offered Eyes</em> now takes on a whole new meaning when shifted into this context. While the Women of Allah series was eventually shown globally, the audience of this remediation consists entirely of New Yorkers. And unlike these gallery showings, each viewer only sees the work in passing, without any context or background. Most likely, they do not know that the eye belongs to a Persian woman, and that the work is partially based in the trauma of the Persian Revolution. Instead they see a foreign looking script surrounding an inquisitive eye, and can make any deduction from there. The viewer, as Shirin said, must certainly feel that the subject of the piece is speaking to them in a foreign language. And perhaps the medium in which the artwork is presented will bring to mind their foreign cab driver, and then the eye will take on the body of this individual. Instead of challenging the viewers preconceptions about Iranian women, now it can challenge the stereotypes against the largely South Asian cab driving fleet.</p>

<p>To provide a little background on the cab driving occupation: In NYC, fleet garages and brokerage houses monopolize the taxi industry. Most all drivers lease out these cars by the day, week or month for exorbitant prices. Only after they have paid off these leases do they begin to make any profit off of their fares. Sometimes, it can be 6 or 7 hours into their 12 hour shifts before a driver even breaks even. Mathew Biju, who worked closely with the New York City Taxi Workers Alliance for over a decade, explains that “At an average, drivers earned less than $5000 per week—working in excess of 72 hours each week—while the garage owners and brokers collected, again at average, in excess of $1,000 per week on each cab. A driver thus earned barely above minimum wage levels” at the start of the millennium.<sup>8</sup></p>

<div class="column">
<p>In addition to the financial struggles that plague this occupation, it also boasts the highest homicide rate of any job in the United States.<sup>9</sup> Additionally, cab drivers are more likely to be the victims of passenger antagonism when they are of a different race or ethnicity.<sup>10</sup> In New York City, where over 95% of the 50,000 or so cab drivers are foreign born, around 85% are Muslim, and 60% of South Asian descent, this fact proves especially relevant.<sup>11</sup><sup>12</sup> Almost the entire fleet are more likely to be the victim of some type of passenger aggression because they are the racial “other.”</p>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, violence against cab drivers spiked significantly, with about 60% of taxi drivers reporting being the victim of some type of racial backlash on the job.<sup>13</sup> Drivers also experienced a sharp decrease in profits due to a variety of reasons: lowered spending on the whole in New York city, fear on behalf of the drivers to resume work (because of an increase in racially charged hate crimes against Muslims or Middle Easterners/South Asians), increased hostility from passengers, and a wave of “regulatory” measures from the Taxi and Limousine commission (a decision many drivers feel was racially charged) that allowed for increased instances of police stoppage and harassment, and cost drivers business.<sup>14</sup></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The general results of the above were an overall increase in stress levels for taxi drivers. The aftermath of 9/11 created stressors regarding financial stability, personal safety, and safety for family members abroad as war loomed overhead.</p>
<p>The racial discrimination against these drivers is perhaps what Neshat wished to call to mind with her piece in 2010. Maybe, in this context, the gaze was meant to confront the western passerby and their possible stereotypes about the workforce that is simultaneously made hyper- visible by the ubiquitous yellow taxi and but invisible by the widespread discrimination against them.</p>
<p>I felt such a connection with the piece that I decided to remediate the original artwork again. What I love most about it is versatility: it is able to communicate the “otherness” of two unique cultures equally well, and adjusts its meaning to its context. It was also featured on an amazing medium that was seen by over 5 million New Yorkers every day. This means that the common man was engaged by this piece as equally as the high-brow Shirin Neshat aficionado that would see the piece in a gallery setting. In other words, the social agenda behind Offered Eyes was doled out indiscriminately to any New Yorker who could see a cab.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>In my reinterpretation, I created a graffiti sticker featuring my own eye and separate imagery evocative of the Middle East. I wanted to keep the photo of the eye because I love the way Neshat is able to create a dialogue between herself and her viewer through this gaze. I tried to duplicate the range of emotion in Shirin’s eye in my own expression.</p>
<p>Instead of the Farsi script, which calls to mind a foreign language to the western viewer, I used a typical Islamic star pattern. This pattern is not based on any specific work already in existence, but is a stereotypical and easily recognizable tile pattern seen in the likes of Moroccan or Turkish architecture. It evokes, in the western mind, an exotic Middle Eastern land.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>I layered the pattern a few times to make it look a bit less romantic and a bit more combative; I didn’t want the viewer to romanticize or exoticize the imagery anymore than it already is. I wanted, instead, the viewer to perhaps feel a bit uncomfortable when looking at this pattern, which is a way the’ve probably never felt before when viewing this type of thing. Even if this strategy, when accompanied with my confrontational gaze, doesn’t cause the viewer to <span style="line-height: 1.5;">immediately realize the ignorance or stereotyping behind </span>this exoticization, at least it will make them feel a slight discomfort and start thinking about why that is.</p>

<p>I chose to make the piece into a sticker to try and reach the same visibility that came with the taxi cab medium. I don’t legally have any access to a stage that large, so I’ve resorted to the illegal.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>I have already stickered before, so putting<br />
up the work wasn’t the real issue. The brunt of the work lay in production: shooting the self-portrait, designing the piece, and printing the sticker. I print all my own work, but I usually work with brightly colored graphics on matte white paper. For this, my design was in black and white, with most of the black being the darkest, truest shade in the printer, on completely clear, glossy vinyl. I soon learned that clear vinyl is quite difficult for many photo printers to handle, spent a lot of time yanking destroyed sheets of vinyl out of the paper feed. True black is also very difficult for it to handle, so the sheets that made it through were often inconsistent in tone. After 20 or so destroyed sheets of vinyl, I finally figured out a good printing process.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 5">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>Then I made the mistake of using a sticky laminate sheet over the sticker, as I usually do for my brightly-colored work. Apparently, this is a horrible weatherproofing method for mostly- black stickers, as any minuscule air bubble between the laminate and sticker becomes extremely obvious because it lessons the boldness of the true black. I lost another batch of stickers to this. But eventually I figured it out.</p>

<p>I’m calling the piece <em>The SubAltern Eye</em>, because it stands for the “othered” nature of Middle Easterners/South Asian New Yorkers, like myself, that has been outlined in this research. The work is up around NYC now, so keep your eyes peeled, because mine are!

<p>Hello Kitty is a global phenomenon. Created in 1974 by Japan’s Sanrio Corporation, the little white cat with a bow in her hair now rakes in about $7b per year, earning company founder Shintaro Tsuji a place among the richest men in the world (Walker). Hello Kitty’s reemergence in the 1990‘s was an early frontrunner in a trend that now includes countless animated shows, Nintendo, the Pokemon franchise, and Harajuku fashion. In 2015, “Kawaii culture” is still on the rise, and continues to influence international perception of Japan.</p>

<div class="column">
<p>American singers capitalizing on the success of Japanese pop culture is nothing new. We saw this in 2004 with Gwen Stefani’s “Harajuku Girls” &#8212; a group of four backup dancers, three Japanese and one Japanese American, who performed with Stefani on tour and in several of her music videos. Nicknamed “Love,” “Angel,” “Music,” and “Baby,” the dancers were frequently criticized for perpetuating stereotypes of Asian woman. Comedienne Margaret Cho, herself of Korean ancestry, likened the ensemble to a “minstrel show,” writing on her blog that “Even though to me, a Japanese schoolgirl uniform is kind of like blackface, I am just in acceptance over it, because something is better than nothing” (Cho).</p>

Although all profess their love of Japanese culture is genuine, the country’s $4.3b music industry is likely also a big motivator (Bremner, Yasu). More Japanese fans means more records sold. Lavigne and the rest are not afraid to tie themselves to popular juggernauts &#8212; consider Perry’s televised meeting with Japanese star Kyary Pamyu Pamyu or Gaga’s seashell bra-adorned Hello Kitty doll. Lavigne’s</p>

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>2014 song “Hello Kitty,” and the accompany music video, is the latest iteration of this financial exploitation of kawaii culture.</p>
<p>“Hello Kitty’s” nonsensical lyrics, coupled with a video that has<br />
been universally condemned, sets it apart as particularly egregious.<br />
Lavigne, dressed in a low-cut black bodice and a cupcake skirt, sings<br />
about a girly sleepover, later chanting a chorus of “Come come kitty kitty, you’re so pretty pretty.” More than nonsensical, the lyrics are also slightly sexual &#8212; some critics have wondered if “kitty” could be a euphemism for female genitalia &#8212; which is creepy in the context of the almost prepubescent-styled dancers and sterile set decor. In any case, Lavigne’s message is unclear.</p>
<p>Whatever the intent, “Hello Kitty” sees Lavigne impose her own view of Japan onto the world. She fetishizes the culture, turning an entire society into “kawaii,” candy, and a cartoon cat. In perpetuating the Harajuku schtick, she lets a subculture be representative of an entire country. The American public is constantly bombarded by stories and images of “weird” Japan, and Lavigne does nothing to change this perception. This is damaging because not only does she profit off misrepresentation, she also encourages her substantial fan base to think of Japan in the same freaky, sexual way she does.</p>
<p>Writing for Vox, critic Zack Beauchamp calls the song and video an “unintentionally offensive homage” (Beauchamp). This is probably a fair assessment, as Lavigne has maintained she had no intention of offending anyone, and worked specifically with Japanese actors and directors in the production of the video (Lavigne). This is to be commended, but a Japanese director and background dancers is not enough. Cross-cultural music and art should be encouraged, but to be cross-cultural means both parties should be given a voice. Had Avril written more meaningful lyrics, collaborated with a Japanese artist, or used Japan in any way other than as decoration, the reaction might have been completely different.</p>

<p>I decided to make a “Hello Kitty” parody, as I thought it would be most appropriate to respond to a song with a song. As I am no music producer, what I ended up creating is more of a rough mix than a fully-mastered product, but the message is there. Had I been able to keep going with this, I would have liked to shoot a video as well and uploaded it to Youtube, as I think that would have a greater impact than a song alone.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>My idea for the parody was to exaggerate Lavigne’s obsession with harajuku/anime culture even further. The lyrics show a person who is a xenophile to the extreme, the hope being that in overemphasizing Lavigne’s behavior, the offense will become clear. I changed almost all of the lyrics, but I kept the original Japanese lines, as I couldn’t think of anything more ridiculous than what she had already written. In my experience, humor is more effective than most things in trying to get a point across, so hopefully you will find this version as funny as I do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Futuba Shioda<br />
Written for Yellow Peril, NYU Spring 2015</p>
<p>It was a slightly cloudy but reasonably sunny day in June, a few days after my fourteenth birthday and several days before school would be released and summer would arrive like an endless, warm embrace of lounging and green ferns. He sat next to me in his old car, parked in front of our old elementary school where we must have crossed paths as small children, but neither of us could remember since he was four years my senior. A senior. I was sitting in a car next to a senior who found me fascinating and adorable and attractive. He had confessed his interest in me soon after graduating high school just a few weeks back, after we had spent the semester in our high school production of <em>Wizard of Oz</em> together. He took me on long walks by the reservoir and gave me my first kiss under luscious trees. He invited me to his graduation party and introduced me to his family. He told me he was infatuated with me. Of course, looking back, the only things I remember him saying on our walks included the words “You” “are” and “cute.” His graduation party was held in the town Rotary Club and I remember seeing a giant painting in the entryway depicting the overtaking of Iwo Jima, which set an uncomfortable tone for being one of three non-white people at the party (one of the others being my best friend whom I dragged along). And I remember Googling “infatuated” and finding the definition slightly concerning; “be inspired with an intense but short-lived passion or admiration for; inspired or possessed with a foolish or unreasoning passion.” I remember having a soft but insistent voice always asking me if he really liked me or if he even really knew me beyond his honeymoon assumptions.</p>
<p>Back in the car, he turned towards me and smiled, handing over a loosely wrapped package. I opened it to find a mixed CD and my heart fluttered, because a real live boy had thoughtfully put together music for me! He smiled wider and said that there was a special surprise at the end of the CD. When I finally got home later that day, I shut myself in the study and put the CD into our CD player, plugged my headphones into it for privacy, and skipped to the final song. I sat there, little tears filling my eyes as I fantasized how we would live our lives out together, listening to his song and whispering aloud that it was the most beautiful song in the world.</p>
<p><span id="more-257"></span>Today, I can say that it’s probably one of the worst songs I’ve ever downloaded onto my iTunes account. It’s not because of the chords, the voice, or even the strange warped guitar slides between every verse. And it’s not because it’s a song written by a guy I used to date and no longer have any connection with (at least not entirely…). It’s because as I’ve grown older, moved out of my small suburban town, seen more of the world and learned more about myself, the lyrics of his song seem progressively more offensive. Here are some of the lyrics from his love ode to me:</p>
<p><em>“I’d travel all the way to Tokyo to see your face…”</em></p>
<p><em>            “All that matters to me is that you will forever be my Tokyo Girl.”</em></p>
<p><em>            “When I hear you speak in native tongue it turns me on…oh you                   make me want to learn the language of the sun.” </em></p>
<p>In addition to these words, the chorus of the song is simply the phrase “Tokyo Girl” repeated over and over again.</p>
<p>Looking back at the context of our situation, the factors and dynamics in our relationship seem almost too cliché. I discovered that in terms of categories, his dominance in society’s hierarchy almost made it inevitable that we viewed each other the way we did. I’m not justifying the creation of his song, but here’s a look at our circumstances.</p>

<p>What were the dynamics in our town? The majority of our peers in high school were white, Christian, conservative, and straight. I was in many of the devalued/desposed/phobic categories of our environment, and he was in many of the valued/loved/philic categories. The number of Pacific Asian students in our school were scarce, only outnumbering the handful of Hispanic students. And to add to this, he was exposed to the generally misleading representation of Asians and Asian women in the media. He <em>did</em> write the song and I place the responsibility of it on him, but he wrote it in a world that conditioned him to see me as an exotic, exciting, foreign object to place upon a pedestal and admire.</p>
<p>The connotation of “Tokyo Girl” is racist because it assumes that I, as an Asian American who was born and raised in the Boston area, am still foreign to a country that I am a citizen of. Associating me with a Japanese city brings up many images and characteristics that define me through a propaganda lens. Asian women are constantly described and depicted as slim, beautiful, fragile geishas who are submissive to men and eager to please both in labor and in sex. This stereotype arises from the Western colonization of Asian countries. As analyzed in the University of Michigan website called “Asian Americans in the Media”, “since colonization inherently implies ownership, Asian women were viewed as commodities to be possessed. Their identities of being Asian females no longer implied agency or invoked a sense of individuality but were viewed by Westerners as “Asian” (UMich; Cheng, Hsieh, Lu, Talgo).</p>
<p>The foreignness of Asian American women continues to “Other” them, as well as objectify them. The main tropes that I find have been used to define me are “The Madame Butterfly” and the “Dragon Lady.” I’m also going to add the “Tokyo Girl” stereotype that arose from the song written to me. These stereotypes are found on TV, movies, music videos, theater, books, and most other media platforms. The “Madame Butterfly” trope is based off of Puccini’s opera of the same name, in which a Japanese geisha kills herself after bearing a son to a Western Lieutenant and waiting for his return, only to discover he has remarried to a white woman. This “prostitute with a golden heart” who needs saving from a Western man is a repeated character, originally derived from the Western need to feminize the East and therefore sexually dominate the East. Examples include Kim from the Broadway musical “Miss Saigon” and Liat from the Broadway musical “South Pacific.” This trope, which has eventually stemmed off into the “Tokyo Girl” trope, adds to the racist idea of “Yellow Fever”, in which white men are afflicted with the romantic and sexual desire for Asian women. The “Dragon Lady” trope, though slightly divergent from my particular experience with the song, is also a repeated trope. A female version of the “Fu Manchu” stereotype, a trope developed from the villain character of “Fu Manchu” (which epitomized the threat of the East during the 20<sup>th</sup> century (and beyond)), the “Dragon Lady” is a severe and heartless Asian woman usually associated with chopsticks, high buns, and weapons in the form of samurai swords and fans.</p>
<p>The “Tokyo Girl” stereotype is a more recent trope that has developed to infantalize the Asian girl. This stereotype takes the long, straight black hair ideal of the “Madame Butterfly” look and makes her an adorable, anime-styled doll who is cute, diminutive, and 2-dimensional. Examples of this trope can be seen in music videos such as “Hello Kitty” by singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne (2013) and “Harajuku Girls” by singer-songwriter Gwen Stefani. Both of these white female artists use Japanese girls as robotic backup dancers who are simultaneously put up on a pedestal and dehumanized. This trope best fits my experience with the song, and perpetuates the idea that I am cute, collectable, and submissive.</p>
<p>In order to combat this racism, many Asian women are showing examples of Asian women who defy this stereotype. For example, the documentary “Seeking Asian Female” (2012) by Debbie Lum follows an older white male who mail orders a Chinese bride in hopes that she will make him happy, serve him, and be the perfect wife. The documentary illustrates how different the Chinese wife is from his assumptions, having fully human desires, complaints, and characteristics, and breaks down both the white man and the Asian American documentarian’s biases about this Chinese woman moving to America for marriage. Further examples include the cartoon “Angry Little Asian Girl” created by Lela Lee in 1994. It portrays a small little Asian girl who, upon first glance, looks like the cute, submissive Asian girl that falls into the “Tokyo Girl” trope. However, in every cartoon and animated episode, the girl showcases her anger towards racism, sexism, and other oppressive hierarchies, by cursing profusely and being vulgar. This cartoon defies the stereotype and portrays more layers of Asian women by representing a new kind of Asian heroine.</p>
<p>I decided to fight the “Tokyo Girl” stereotype by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9xQsoT_KkE" target="_blank">writing a rebuttal song</a> to the song my ex wrote for me. In response to his racist lyrics, I wrote these lyrics:</p>
<p><iframe width="474" height="356" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s9xQsoT_KkE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Hey ___, Do you remember me?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>You wrote a song for me back when I was about fourteen</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>It was endearing, but upon hearing it again</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’m kind of feeling a lot of things</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Like “What the fuck were you thinking?”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’m not trying to paint you as an ass</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I promise I’m doing this for a class</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>But you called me your Tokyo girl</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Frankly that just makes me want to hurl</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I am not your geisha toy</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The same way you’re not a pilgrim boy</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’ll break it down for you</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>My passport’s red and white and blue</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Now that you’re twenty-four</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I should tell you, I’d never been to Tokyo before</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>But even if I had, let me say it’s just as bad</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>But maybe the fault is really mine</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I should’ve said, “I won’t love you long time.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Your assumptions were downright wrong</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>And don’t say my native tongue “turns you on”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>And you called me your Tokyo Girl</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Frankly that just makes me want to hurl</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I’m not saying I’m not Japanese</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Just don’t assume I’m good at math please</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>But I am not your Tokyo Girl</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Frankly that just makes me actually hurl</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Society told you that I’m foreign a bit</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Now you know that that’s racist shit</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em><em>That’s racist shit…”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This sort of response gives voice to the masses of Asian women who are clumped together and defined through racist, oppressive ideals. By combating the stereotypes and tropes placed on Asian and Asian American women, while also recognizing and celebrating our identities in both communal and individual senses, the racist homogenization of Asians in America can be tackled.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent <em>New York Times </em>feature highlighting the story of Sherry Chen, a Chinese American hydrologist accused of economic espionage, sheds light on the impacts that a Yellow Perilist gaze can have on an individual&#8217;s rights and treatment under the law.</p>
<p>Chen, who was born in China but is now a naturalized US citizen, was falsely accused of economic espionage on behalf of the Chinese government based on an innocuous email exchange with an old classmate who happened to be vice minister of China&#8217;s Ministry of Water Resources.</p>
<p><a href="http://jonoyuan.github.io/yellowperilarchive/wp-content/uploads/ESPIONAGE-master675.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-207" src="http://jonoyuan.github.io/yellowperilarchive/wp-content/uploads/ESPIONAGE-master675.jpg" alt="ESPIONAGE-master675" width="675" height="483" srcset="http://jonoyuan.github.io/yellowperilarchive/wp-content/uploads/ESPIONAGE-master675.jpg 675w, http://jonoyuan.github.io/yellowperilarchive/wp-content/uploads/ESPIONAGE-master675-300x215.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px" /></a></p>
<p>Under President Obama, the US has launched the Economic Espionage Act to combat fears that Chinese hackers may be accessing confidential economic information from the United States. As a consequence, the Justice Department has been more aggressively pursuing prosecutions.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<p>&#8221; &#8216;They came across a person of Chinese descent and a little bit of evidence that they may have been trying to benefit the Chinese government, but it&#8217;s clear there was a little bit of Red Scare and racism involved,&#8217; said Peter J. Toren, a former federal prosecutor who specialized in computer crimes and industrial espionage.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;In short, the larger racial culture predisposed voters to believe a yellow-peril war script. And the same culture had true believers imagining that the virile Marines would quickly prevail over short, heathen “gooks.” In hindsight, we know none of this was true at that time. We should also know that this paranoid style has not served our nation well in the half century since (WMDs, anyone?). Putting the Gulf of Tonkin “incident” into this larger historical arc helps us understand why, when stereotypes pervade the public imagination, a democratic society can be vulnerable to systemic misinformation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
